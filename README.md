# Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Prediction
Kidney disease encompasses various abnormalities in renal function, ranging from subtle damage to severe conditions such as excessive cell expansion, impaired blood filtration, and the deposition of crystalline minerals. Recognizing its significant impact on mortality and years of life lost, early detection becomes paramount in providing timely and focused medical interventions. This research employs a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Xg-
Boost, Cat Boost Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Evaluation of these algorithms reveals outstanding performance by Ada Boost, XgBoost, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) Classifier, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%. This study underscores the pivotal role of machine learning in early predicting kidney disease, paving the way for personalized patient care.
